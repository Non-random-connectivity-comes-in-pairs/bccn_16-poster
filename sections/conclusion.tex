\section*{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item In networks with symmetric connection probabilities in pairs any non-random network structure induces an overrepresentation of bidirectionally connected neuron pairs
  \item Neuron properties, such as inter-neuron distance, age or orientation preference, that impose a discrete or continuous distribution of connection probabilities, can significantly affect the relative occurrence of reciprocal pairs
  \item Understanding of local cortical circuits requires a more refined view of non-random network connectivity that goes beyond bidirectional pairs and focuses on the emergence of higher order network structures
\end{itemize}
