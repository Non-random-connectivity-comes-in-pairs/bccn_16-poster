\section*{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item In networks with symmetric connection probabilities in pairs any non-random network structure induces an overrepresentation of bidirectionally connected neuron pairs
  \item Both discrete (e.g.~common orientation preference or feature encoding) and continuous neuron properties (e.g.~inter-neuron distance, age) can significantly affect the relative occurrence of reciprocal pairs
  \item More refined view of non-random network connectivity that goes beyond bidirectional pairs and focus on the emergence on higher order network structures is necessary for the understanding of local cortical circuits
\end{itemize}
