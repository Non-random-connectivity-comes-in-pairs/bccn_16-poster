  Overrepresentation of bidirectional connections in local cortical networks has been repeatedly reported and is in the focus of the ongoing discussion of non-random connectivity.
  %
  Here we show in a brief mathematical analysis that in a network in which connection probabilities are symmetric in pairs, $P_{ij} = P_{ji}$, the occurrence of bidirectional connections and non-random structures are inherently linked; an overabundance of reciprocally connected pairs emerges necessarily when the network structure deviates from a random network in any form.
  %
  %For two distributions of connection probabilities, the discrete two-point distribution and continuous gamma distribution, we quantify how a more organized structure increases reciprocity in the network.
