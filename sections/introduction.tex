\section*{Introduction}

Increasing evidence implies that cortical microcircuitry is highly structured \cite{Song2005,Perin2011}.
%
The relative occurrence of bidirectionally connected pairs has been of particular interest and connectivity of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the rat visual cortex \cite{Song2005} and somatosensory cortex \cite{Markram1997, Perin2011} was shown to have a significantly stronger reciprocity than expected.
%
However, the exact relationship between non-random network structure and the relative occurrence of bidirectionally connected neuron pairs has not been explained.
